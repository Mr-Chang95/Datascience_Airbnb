# Udacity Data Science NanoDegree - Airbnb Project
## Motivation
For this project, I am interest in using the 2016-17 Seattle and Boston Airbnb datasets to answer the following questions:
    1. What are the important amenities of these listings? Compare the two cities.
    2. Is it possible to predict the price with 8 features? If yes, compare the 2 cities.
    3. How does the price in each city change each month? Be sure to compare the 2 cities.
    4. How does total number of listings change each month? Be sure to compare the 2 cities.
 Consider this my credit for the datasets I've used. Big thanks to Kaggle and Udacity. Here are the links to the datasets:

    2. https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston
I chose not to include the .csv file because I would like the extra practice of using and writing in the .gitignore file.

## File Descriptions
You will find 4 Jupyter Notebook files in this repository. Part I mainly deals with examining and understanding the datasets. I have also answered some basic questions about the datasets in this part.

The next 3 parts deal with answering the questions that I have posed. Most of them require a bit of legwork before I could answer them.

The catboost_info folder is related to the model I tested in Part III.
